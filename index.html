            <h2>Origins of Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                Basketball was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a physical education instructor in Springfield, Massachusetts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal was to create a new indoor game that could be played during the winter months while keeping athletes active.
